# Migrations

A migration is an application-level transformation of saved data. GraphEvo
provides the lifecycle and ledger, but does not decide how to interpret the
application's data.

## When a migration is needed

Use a migration when the meaning or format of properties, entity identity, or
relationship structure changes. An incompatible Core Data model change is not
migrated automatically.

## Contract

Implement `GraphMigration`:

```swift
struct AddNoteStatus: GraphMigration {
    let id = "add-note-status"
    let version = 1

    func needsRun(
        at phase: GraphMigrationManager.GraphLifecyclePhase,
        configuration: GraphStoreConfiguration?,
        graph: Graph?,
        context: inout GraphMigrationContext?
    ) -> Bool {
        phase == .postMigration
    }

    func handlePhase(
        _ phase: GraphMigrationManager.GraphLifecyclePhase,
        configuration: GraphStoreConfiguration?,
        graph: Graph?,
        context: GraphMigrationContext?,
        completion: @escaping (GraphMigrationResult) -> Void
    ) {
        // Transform data...
        completion(.done)
    }
}
```

Other protocol functions define backup behavior, remote-change handling, legacy
completion recognition, and state reset.

## Phases

- `.preInit`: before the graph fully opens;
- `.postInit`: after initialization;
- `.postMigration`: the migration phase;
- `.ready`: the graph is ready for normal use.

Graph invokes these phases automatically in the order shown. A migration that
spans phases remains owned by the same per-store coordinator.

Register migrations before creating the graph:

```swift
GraphMigrationManager.registerMigration(AddNoteStatus())
```

Registration occurs once per `id`, and execution follows registration order.

## Results and state

The completion receives `GraphMigrationResult`: `.done` for completion,
`.error(Error)` for failure, `.fallback` for an alternative path, and
`.skipped` when no migration is required.

The versioned ledger exposes `GraphMigrationRecord` and the `started`, `done`,
`notRequired`, `notExecuted`, and `failed` states. Its history is retained per
store and survives retries and resets. An application error is emitted as
`GraphFailure.migration`; it does not automatically mean that the graph is
unusable.

Ledger schema 1 separates the current projection from the append-only JSONL
history. Ordinary state reads decode only the projection; diagnostics and
recovery tools load history explicitly. A flushed transaction journal makes a
projection/history transition replayable after interruption without duplicating
an event. Legacy unversioned records are schema 0 and are upgraded directly to
schema 1. Other versioned formats are rejected without overwriting their files.
History is limited to 2 MB per normalized store scope; older events are folded
into a diagnostic summary while the current projection and recovery-relevant
tail remain available.

Retention runs within the same serial ledger operation as the commit. There is
no separate utility-queue/semaphore handoff when called from the main thread.
Ledger APIs remain synchronous: retention completes before return, errors are
propagated, and concurrent callers cannot race history compaction.

Migration queues and contexts are isolated per normalized store. The
application still supplies only its `GraphStoreConfiguration`; GraphEvo derives
the internal store scope and CloudKit environment. A one-shot local force or a
targeted reset can be requested with the additive manager APIs:

```swift
try GraphMigrationManager.forceMigration(migration, configuration: configuration)
try GraphMigrationManager.resetRecord(
    for: migration,
    configuration: configuration,
    targets: [.local, .remote],
    requestedBy: .supportCenter,
    reason: "Rebuild migration projection"
)
```

A reset appends a structured `notExecuted` event rather than deleting history.
A remote reset publishes that new projection to KVS; KVS is observational and
is never interpreted as a command channel.

The local projection keeps remote observations, the last projection accepted
by the local ubiquitous KVS store, and any publication still pending as
separate values. A failed or interrupted publication remains pending and is
surfaced as an error; GraphEvo retries the same operation ID during
reconciliation and after external KVS notifications. Acceptance does not mean
that another device
has already received the value; KVS provides no remote-delivery acknowledgement.

Diagnostic clients can read the immutable ledger history and current snapshot:

```swift
let history = try GraphMigrationManager.history(
    for: migration,
    configuration: configuration
)
let snapshot = try GraphMigrationManager.stateSnapshot(
    for: migration,
    configuration: configuration
)
```

These APIs propagate ledger, reconciliation, and publication errors. The
compatibility `record(for:configuration:)` API remains available for callers
that use its optional return value.

## Context

### Historical recovery outcome

After successfully publishing recovered domain data, an application can call
`GraphMigrationManager.recordRecoverySummary(for:configuration:recoveryID:recordsRequiringManualReview:)`.
Read it with `recoverySummary(for:configuration:)`, which throws on ledger errors
and returns nil for older ledgers without a summary. This local-only snapshot
contains `recoveryID`, `completedAt`, `recordsRequiringManualReview`, and the
derived `requiresManualReview` flag. It does not modify technical migration state,
query domain objects, or activate migration/synchronization work.

Use a stable publication identity across retries; replaying the latest identity
is a no-op. A subsequent completed recovery uses a new identity. Evaluation
resets and failed retries preserve the last successful snapshot; ordinary user
edits never update it. The summary is in the journaled local ledger projection,
not KVS. A changed save posts `.graphMigrationRecoverySummaryDidChange` on the
main queue with a `GraphMigrationRecoverySummaryChange` in `notification.object`
(storeScope, migrationID, version, summary). Observe globally and filter the
payload for the active store. Always read on launch: notifications are transient,
and crash journal recovery is observed through the read API.

`GraphMigrationContext` passes data between phases.
`previousMigrationRecord` exposes the previous record when available, while
`migrationStateSnapshot` contains local and observed remote state, generation,
operation ID, phase, backup reference, attempt count, and interruption state.
After an interrupted `started` attempt, GraphEvo preserves the record until the
phase that originally started it. In that phase, `needsRun` must inspect durable
store data and make an idempotent decision: return `true` when work is missing
or uncertain, and `false` only when the saved transformation is verifiably
compatible. GraphEvo cannot infer an application's semantic postcondition, and
a consumed force request is not replayed.

## Safety rules

Applications requiring pre-init recovery before opening CloudKit may opt into
`configuration.waitsForApplicationMigrations = true`. The asynchronous pre-init
completion becomes a real opening barrier; migration and ledger failures stop
readiness. The default remains diagnostic-only for backward compatibility.

Use `graph.transaction` for application-owned reconciliation: it creates an
isolated Graph facade, commits data and application markers in one context save,
and rolls back on errors/conflicts. The body must have no external side effects.
Persist reports/checkpoints before entering it and recheck the analyzed input
inside it. Never replace a live SQLite family. Reconcile again after concurrent
CloudKit imports, which the transaction API does not suspend.

For a refused transaction with pending view edits, consume the
`GraphFailure.transaction` event before the enclosing migration failure. Its
value-only diagnostics identify the rejection checkpoint and changed Core Data
schema groups without exposing payloads. The thrown error type is preserved;
the diagnostic does not implicitly retry, save or roll back user edits.

DEBUG transaction diagnostics additionally expose optional payload-bearing
`debugDetails` for application-owned test logging. The schema-only summary is
unchanged; see the API reference for limits and `pendingChangeDiagnostics`.

After a deletion commit, `transaction` may finalize residual view-context
deletions only if every pending change matches an ID deleted by that commit.
Inserts, updates, changed fields or unrelated deletions prevent this internal
finalization. Tests cover retained nodes, rewired relationships, bulk local wipe,
deferred merges, unchanged SQLite history transaction count during finalization,
and preservation of an unsaved insertion made by a merge observer.


1. Back up persistent data before transforming it.
2. Make the migration repeatable or check the ledger before running it.
3. Do not delete the original store before verifying the result.
4. Record migration errors and version.
5. Test both success and restoration after failure.
6. Treat `.started` as potentially interrupted work and make recovery safe.
