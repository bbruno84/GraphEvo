# Persistent History

Persistent History identifies changes saved in Core Data since the last
processing point. GraphEvo uses it to deliver changes from other contexts and
CloudKit to watchers.

## Startup

Call the public method after the persistent container is ready:

```swift
graph.ph_prepareOnLaunchAfterContainerReady()
```

GraphEvo loads the saved token or prepares an initial session without losing
the required history.

## Processing

`processPersistentHistoryForRemoteChange()` queues processing. To process one
batch with a completion:

```swift
graph.processPersistentHistoryBatch { processed in
    print("Batch processed: \(processed)")
}
```

The general flow is: load the latest token; read subsequent transactions;
ignore local-authored transactions when appropriate; collect inserted, updated,
and deleted object IDs; merge changes into the observed context; notify
watchers; and save the new token only after delivery.

## Tokens

The token is stored on disk at a store-associated path and also kept in a local
backup. With `appGroupIdentifier`, the token path may reside in the App Group.

Token identity is derived from the canonical URL and, when available, the
persistent store's `NSStoreUUID`. If GraphEvo detects a rebuilt store with a
new identity, it does not reuse the previous token.

The token identifies a processed history position, not a domain object. Do not
use it to reconstruct entity identity directly.

## Duplicate callbacks

GraphEvo assigns a transaction author to local contexts and filters transactions
from the originating device. The app must still design idempotent callbacks:
the same change may be observed at different times when Core Data, CloudKit,
and the UI use different contexts.

## Events and errors

Corrupt tokens are invalidated together with the file and UserDefaults backup,
and GraphEvo moves recovery to the current history head. The same recovery is
used for `NSCocoaErrorDomain` `134301` (an expired token) and `134501` (a token
that refers to a missing store).

The coordinator does not retry the invalid token on later remote-change
notifications and GraphEvo emits one `GraphWarning.persistentHistoryRecovery`
diagnostic. This bootstrap may skip transactions no longer representable by the
token; it does not generate artificial watcher callbacks.

Other token errors produce `GraphWarning.persistentHistoryTokenStore`; a
transaction without an author produces
`GraphWarning.persistentHistoryMissingTransactionAuthor`; processing errors
produce `GraphFailure.persistentHistory`. Use `GraphEventDelegate` to record
them.

`ph_debug_*` helpers are intended for tests and diagnostics, not normal
application flow. Variants without `print` in the name produce no implicit
output; `ph_debug_print...` variants print only when explicitly called.
