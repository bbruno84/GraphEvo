# Watchers and change events

`Watch<T>` receives notifications when nodes of a given type change. It is
useful for updating a UI or reacting to data from another context or CloudKit.

## Create a watcher

Watchers are typed and initially stopped:

```swift
final class EntityEvents: GraphEntityDelegate {
    func graph(_ graph: Graph, inserted entity: Entity, source: GraphSource) {
        print("Inserted \(entity.type) from \(source)")
    }
}

let entityEvents = EntityEvents()
let watch = Watch<Entity>(graph: graph)
watch.delegate = entityEvents
watch.where(.type("Note"))
watch.resume()
```

The app must keep the delegate alive. `Watch<Entity>` uses
`GraphEntityDelegate`; use `GraphRelationshipDelegate` or
`GraphActionDelegate` for the other node types.

## Lifecycle

- `resume()` starts observation;
- `pause()` suspends it and removes observations;
- `clear()` removes the filter;
- deallocating the watcher automatically removes observations.

Reuse a watcher by calling `pause()`, changing its filter, and calling `resume()`.

## Callback types

The three delegates cover node insertion, update, and deletion; property
addition, modification, and removal; tag addition and removal; and entering
and leaving groups. For a relationship or action, the main parameter changes
type but the callback shape remains the same.

## Change source

`GraphSource.local` indicates a change observed in the local context.
`GraphSource.cloud` indicates a change processed through Persistent History
from another context or CloudKit.

Do not assume that every Cloud change produces exactly one callback: transaction
authors and ordered merges reduce duplicates, but the app must keep callbacks
idempotent.

## Aggregated reports

Use the Graph-level report delegate when the application needs one callback per
local save or Persistent History processing cycle:

```swift
final class BatchEvents: GraphWatchReportDelegate {
    func graph(_ graph: Graph, didReceive report: GraphWatchReport) {
        switch report.source {
        case .local: handleLocal(report.events)
        case .cloud: handleCloud(report.events)
        }
    }
}

let batchEvents = BatchEvents()
graph.watchReportSources = [.cloud]
graph.watchReportDelegate = batchEvents
```

The app must retain the delegate. The delegate is weak, reports are delivered
on the main thread, and no empty report is sent. A report contains all
Graph-level events for its source; it does not use any `Watch` predicate.

Local reports use a context save as their boundary. Deletions are captured
before the save so the report can retain the same typed Graph wrappers used by
legacy callbacks. Cloud reports use one Persistent History processing cycle as
their boundary.

Events have deterministic report ordering. Cloud transactions are ordered by
transaction number, timestamp, and fetch position. Changes within a transaction
are ordered by event kind, object URI, and property, tag, or group name. This
stable order does not promise to reproduce the incidental iteration order of
legacy callback sets.

Batch and legacy delivery remain independent. A Graph may use cloud batches
while retaining local atomic callbacks, but GraphEvo does not suppress either
path automatically.

## Filters

```swift
watch.where(.type("User"))
watch.where(.has(tags: "active"))
```

As with `Search`, successive `where` calls are combined with OR. Build one
`Predicate` when an explicit AND is required.
