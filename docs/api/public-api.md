# GraphEvo — public API reference

GraphEvo is a Swift library for organizing connected data. It is built on Core
Data and supports both local stores and CloudKit-backed stores.

This document summarizes the public API, common usage patterns, and important
behavioral contracts. The source in `Sources/GraphEvo` and the test suite remain
the authoritative implementation references.

## 1. Module identity

```swift
import GraphEvo
```

- Public module: `GraphEvo`
- Supported platforms: iOS 16+, macOS 12+
- Runtime dependencies: none beyond the Apple platform frameworks required by GraphEvo
- CloudKit backend: `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` when configured

The public domain model consists of `Graph`, `Node`, `Entity`, `Relationship`,
`Action`, `Search`, and `Watch`.

## 2. Store configuration

```swift
public struct GraphStoreConfiguration {
    public var name: String
    public var location: URL?
    public var backend: GraphStoreBackend
    public var appGroupIdentifier: String?
    public var cloudKitContainerIdentifier: String?
}
```

`location` is treated as an explicit SQLite file when its extension is
`.sqlite`; otherwise it is treated as a directory. For a directory, GraphEvo
builds `GraphEvo_<name>.sqlite`. An explicit file path is authoritative and is
never rewritten.

Important calculated properties include:

- `resolvedLocation`: the effective directory after App Group resolution;
- `storeURL`: the canonical URL calculated from the configuration;
- `legacyStoreURLs`: candidate legacy paths;
- `resolvedStoreURL`: the URL actually selected for opening.

GraphEvo internally identifies whether the resolved store is for CloudKit
Development, CloudKit Production, or local persistence. Directory-based
CloudKit stores select the environment automatically; Development stores use a
`-dev` filename suffix. `Graph(storeURL:)` always uses local persistence. The
environment is exposed as read-only `environment: GraphStoreEnvironment?`
(`development`, `production`, `local`). Before opening, call
`try configuration.resolvingEnvironment()` to obtain a normalized copy using
the same container precedence and signed-environment resolver as Graph and
the migration ledger. It does not open or mutate a store; unavailable CloudKit
environment information throws. Use the returned copy for URL/scope decisions.
Applications cannot set the environment. XCTest retains its existing simulated
Development resolution and does not establish actual CloudKit availability.

For `.inMemory`, URLs are still calculated for consistency but do not identify a
persistent file. `appGroupIdentifier` affects directory-based configurations;
it does not move an explicit SQLite file.

## 3. `Graph`

```swift
public init(configuration: GraphStoreConfiguration,
            migrationEnabled: Bool = true,
            preflight: (() throws -> Void)? = nil)
public init(storeURL: URL,
            backend: GraphStoreBackend = .sqlite,
            migrationEnabled: Bool = true)
```

`Graph(storeURL:)` always opens the supplied store as local persistence. It
does not inherit a CloudKit container identifier from `Graph`, configuration,
or `Info.plist`.

`Graph` opens a store and owns the Core Data context used by the public facades.
An optional synchronous `preflight` validates application opening policy before
any ledger or store activity. Its failure reports failed readiness using
`applicationMigrationFailed`, including when migrations are disabled or their
ledger is already complete. The default preserves existing behavior. Keep this
callback read-only; do not open another Graph or do asynchronous work inside it.
Use `whenReady` when opening must be coordinated explicitly:

```swift
let graph = Graph(configuration: configuration)
graph.whenReady { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let graph): graph.sync()
    case .failure(let error): print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Common properties and operations include `name`, `configuration`, `readiness`,
`isReady`, `batchSize`, `batchOffset`, and `eventDelegate`,
`sync()`, `async()`, `clear()`, `reset()`, `newBackgroundContext()`, and
`whenReady(_:)`.

`GraphReadiness` describes technical store availability:

```swift
public enum GraphReadiness {
    case initializing
    case ready
    case failed(Error)
}
```

`GraphStoreOpeningError` includes incompatible, unreadable, failed-to-load,
environment, registry-conflict, and incompatible-registered-store cases. An
incompatible store is not changed automatically.

## 4. Nodes and domain objects

`Node.setCreatedDate(_:)` preserves an imported creation timestamp on an existing
node without changing its persistent ID. Save through `sync` or an enclosing
`Graph.transaction`.

### Required application migrations and scoped transactions

`GraphStoreConfiguration.waitsForApplicationMigrations` defaults to `false`.
When enabled, no persistent context is opened until asynchronous `.preInit`
work finishes successfully. All subsequent migration phases must also succeed
before readiness becomes `.ready`. A migration or ledger failure reports
`GraphStoreOpeningError.applicationMigrationFailed(underlying:)`.

`GraphMigrationManager.handlePhaseResult(_:configuration:graph:completion:)`
returns `Result<Void, Error>`. The existing completion-only overload preserves
its diagnostic-only failure contract.

`Graph.transaction<T>(_ body: (Graph) throws -> T) throws -> T` supplies an
isolated, pinned private-context facade and saves once after the body succeeds.
Only return value snapshots; do not retain its Graph/Nodes or call `sync` inside
the body. Errors roll back the private context. Existing object IDs and store
metadata remain unchanged. Pending view-context edits cause a retryable error.
This check runs both before computation and immediately before commit. The view
queue is held only for the final check/save/merge, protecting edits made while
the private body was running without holding the UI queue during computation.
SQLite generation changes detected before save and optimistic locking conflicts
fail the transaction. This does not stop external CloudKit imports: concurrent
insertions after the last generation check must be handled by a subsequent
idempotent reconciliation pass. No filesystem replacement is performed.

Before a commit containing deletions, registered view objects updated or deleted
by that transaction are refaulted while the view is verified clean. This prevents
stale materialized property relationships from leaving already-saved deletions
pending in the view context. The commit is merged using object IDs, not private
context objects. Read-only transactions do not refresh objects; unrelated view
objects and genuine unsaved edits are preserved.

Retained whole-node deletions can still remain pending after Core Data's merge.
The transaction finalizes the view context only when its entire pending set is
made of deletions whose IDs were reported deleted by this successful private
save, with no changed fields, inserts, updates or unrelated deletions. This is
not a general-purpose automatic save or rollback of user changes. SQLite tests
verify that this finalization creates no additional persistent-history
transaction and that the deferred automatic merge leaves the view clean.
Automatic merging stays enabled; CloudKit imports are not suspended. A failure
during finalization is propagated even though the private commit has succeeded;
callers must retain their idempotent retry semantics.

Pending view changes also emit `GraphFailure.transaction(underlying:diagnostics:)`
through `GraphEventDelegate`, while still throwing the original
`GraphTransactionError.pendingUserChanges` (NSError code 1). The error now has a
readable `LocalizedError` description. `GraphTransactionDiagnostics` distinguishes
`beforeBody` from `beforeCommit` and reports actual container kind, object counts,
and up to 20 groups of Core Data entity/schema keys and current-event keys.
Its `summary` contains no property values, dynamic domain names/keys, object IDs,
paths or account identifiers. Diagnostics neither save nor discard pending changes.
The host application owns logging; GraphEvo does not write these events to a log.

In DEBUG builds, rejected transactions also populate `debugDetails` with dynamic
property names, changed fields' committed/current values, object URI IDs and
materialized owner type/properties, and whole nodes' type/properties (including
deleted nodes when still materialized). These details can contain sensitive data;
applications must explicitly choose whether to log them. Release builds always
return an empty detail list. The DEBUG-only
`graph.pendingChangeDiagnostics(checkpoint:)` captures the same details without
attempting a transaction or emitting a failure. It can also report a clean
context at an application lifecycle checkpoint.

Details are bounded to 100 changed objects, 40 materialized owner properties,
and 2,048 characters per textual value. Binary data reports byte count and its
first 64 bytes in base64. Faults are identified without forcing their values;
no permanent IDs are allocated. Committed values are the context's committed
snapshot, not an independent disk read. No stack trace or write-origin tracking
is implied by this diagnostic.


`Node` is the common base for all public graph objects. It exposes `graph`,
`type`, `id`, `createdDate`, dynamic property access through
`node["key"]`, tags, groups, and `delete()`.

### `Entity`

```swift
public init(_ type: String, graph: Graph)
```

An `Entity` is a domain object with dynamic properties, tags, groups,
relationships, and actions. Use `Entity` rather than Core Data `Managed*`
classes.

```swift
let user = Entity("User", graph: graph)
user["email"] = "ada@example.com"
user.add(tags: "active")
```

Relationship and action shortcuts include `is(relationship:)`, `will(action:)`,
and `did(action:)`.

### `Relationship`

A relationship is a directed, typed edge with `subject` and `object` entities.
It can be created fluently:

```swift
user.is(relationship: "writes").of(note)
```

The related accessors distinguish `relationshipsWhenSubject` and
`relationshipsWhenObject`.

### `Action`

An action represents an event with one or more `subjects` and `objects`:

```swift
let review = user.will(action: "reviews")
review.add(objects: note)
```

`subjects`, `objects`, `actionsWhenSubject`, and `actionsWhenObject` expose the
associated domain entities.

### Tags and groups

Node mutations are fluent and set-based:

```swift
user.add(tags: "active", "verified")
user.remove(tags: "verified")
user.toggle(tags: "featured")
user.add(to: "authors")
```

`has(tags:using:)` supports `.and` and `.or`. Tags and groups do not contain
duplicates.

## 5. Predicates and search

`Predicate` provides typed constructors such as `.type`, `.exists`, `.has`, and
`.member`, together with property comparisons and the operators `&&`, `||`, and
`!`. String comparisons are case- and diacritic-insensitive.

```swift
let filter = (.type("User") && .has(tags: "active")) || .type("Admin")
let users = Search<Entity>(graph: graph).where(filter).sync()
```

`Search<T>` supports `Entity`, `Relationship`, and `Action`:

```swift
public init(graph: Graph)
public func `where`(_ predicate: Predicate) -> Search<T>
public func sync() -> [T]
public func async(completion: @escaping ([T]) -> Void)
```

Successive `where` calls are combined with OR. Searches combined with `+` must
belong to the same graph. A search without a predicate returns an empty array.

## 6. Watchers

`Watch<T>` observes changes to typed nodes:

```swift
public init(graph: Graph)
public weak var delegate: GraphNodeDelegate?
public var isRunning: Bool { get }
public func clear() -> Watch<T>
public func `where`(_ predicate: Predicate) -> Watch<T>
public func resume() -> Watch<T>
public func pause() -> Watch<T>
```

Watchers start stopped. `resume()` begins observation, `pause()` suspends it,
and `clear()` removes its filter. Use `GraphEntityDelegate`,
`GraphRelationshipDelegate`, or `GraphActionDelegate` according to `T`.
Callbacks cover insertion, update, deletion, property changes, tag changes, and
group membership changes. `GraphSource.local` and `.cloud` identify the change
source.

### Aggregated Watch reports

`Graph` also exposes an optional Graph-level batch path. It does not inherit or
apply predicates from individual `Watch` instances:

```swift
public enum GraphWatchEvent { /* typed Entity, Relationship, and Action cases */ }

public final class GraphWatchReport {
    public let graph: Graph
    public let source: GraphSource
    public let events: [GraphWatchEvent]
}

public typealias GraphWatchReportCompletion = (_ report: GraphWatchReport?, _ error: Error?) -> Void

public var Graph.watchReportCompletion: GraphWatchReportCompletion?
public var Graph.watchReportSources: Set<GraphSource>
```

`GraphWatchEvent` has one case for every atomic Watch callback: node insertion
and deletion, relationship update, and property, tag, and group addition,
update, or removal for the supported node family. Deleted events retain the
same `Entity`, `Relationship`, or `Action` wrappers used by legacy Watch.

Reports are non-empty, immutable, and delivered on the main thread. They are
not `Sendable`; their objects remain tied to the Graph managed object context.
The completion receives `(report, nil)` after a successful delivery. Structural
failures receive `(nil, error)`. A Persistent History retention gap may produce
`(report, error)` for best-effort delivery. Materialization failures are
retryable: no completion is called and the batch delivery token remains
unchanged. The default source set is `[.local, .cloud]`. Restrict it before
assigning the completion when only one source is wanted.

Batch reporting and legacy watchers are parallel. Enabling reports does not
disable atomic callbacks, so applications must not process both paths as the
same logical consumer unless duplicate handling is intentional.

## 7. Events and CloudKit

```swift
public enum GraphPersistenceMode { case local; case cloud; case localFallback }
public enum GraphEvent {
    case stateChanged(GraphState)
    case warning(GraphWarning)
    case error(GraphFailure)
}
// GraphFailure additionally reports watchEventMaterialization when one
// change cannot be represented while the remaining batch continues.
public enum GraphCloudImportState {
    case started(GraphCloudImportEvent)
    case finished(GraphCloudImportEvent)
}
public struct GraphCloudImportEvent {
    public let identifier: UUID?
    public let storeIdentifier: String
    public let isInitialImport: Bool
    public let succeeded: Bool
    public let startDate: Date?
    public let endDate: Date?
    public let error: Error?
}
public enum GraphCloudUploadState {
    case started(GraphCloudUploadEvent)
    case finished(GraphCloudUploadEvent)
}
public struct GraphCloudUploadEvent {
    public let identifier: UUID
    public let storeIdentifier: String
    public let startDate: Date?
    public let endDate: Date?
    public let succeeded: Bool
    public let error: Error?
}
public protocol GraphEventDelegate: AnyObject {
    func graph(_ graph: Graph, didReceive event: GraphEvent)
}
```

Events are delivered on the main thread. States and warnings are not printed
automatically; the application decides how to log them. Unrecoverable errors
remain available as minimal diagnostics.

CloudKit container precedence is explicit configuration, runtime
`Graph.cloudKitContainerIdentifier`, then the
`GraphCloudKitContainerIdentifier` Info.plist key. Without an identifier the
graph remains local. If CloudKit is unavailable, GraphEvo may emit
`GraphWarning.cloudStoreFallback` and use a local fallback.

`purgeCloudStore(completion:)` is restricted to a loaded CloudKit container and
uses Apple's purge of records and corresponding managed objects. It does not
delete or recreate local SQLite files. During purge, saves and transactions
fail with `GraphCloudPurgeError.writesBlockedDuringPurge`. After successful Apple
completion, the view context is reset and writes are enabled before the app's
callback. Clients reload cached nodes in that callback, without reopening the
Graph. Clients must stop their own raw-context writers during purge.
Errors also release the gate. No thread-owned lock is held
across Apple's asynchronous callback. Import and export lifecycle
updates are delivered through `GraphEventDelegate`.

## 8. Persistent History

`Graph.resetLocalStore(configuration:beforeReset:)` is a pre-open local-replica
reset. It normalizes configuration and refuses an in-process registered Graph
under the store-opening lock. The required throwing callback receives the exact
URL so the caller can back up and persist its scoped intent first. Callback
failure leaves the store untouched. Do not open a Graph from that callback.
Destruction uses Core Data's SQLite API with force-destruction disabled, preserving
its lock/journal handling; errors propagate. No CloudKit container is created and
no remote deletion is sent. Applications own restart, durable reset recovery,
backup verification and preventing replay of historical migration sources.

```swift
@objc func ph_prepareOnLaunchAfterContainerReady()
func processPersistentHistoryForRemoteChange()
func processPersistentHistoryBatch(completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void)
```

Call the preparation method after the persistent container is ready. GraphEvo
stores a token, filters local-authored transactions, merges object changes, and
advances the token after watcher delivery. Corrupt, expired (`134301`), or
missing-store (`134501`) tokens are recovered at the current history head and
reported through `GraphWarning.persistentHistoryRecovery`.

`ph_debug_*` helpers are public test/diagnostic seams and are not an application
contract.

## 9. Migrations

```swift
public protocol GraphMigration {
    var id: String { get }
    var version: Int { get }
    func handlePhase(... completion: @escaping (GraphMigrationResult) -> Void)
    func needsRun(...) -> Bool
}

GraphMigrationManager.registerMigration(migration)
```

Lifecycle phases are `.preInit`, `.postInit`, `.postMigration`, and `.ready`.
Graph executes all four phases automatically in that order. Registration is
once per migration ID and follows registration order.

`GraphMigrationResult` includes `.done`, `.error(Error)`, `.fallback`, and
`.skipped`. `GraphMigrationContext` passes values between phases and exposes
`previousMigrationRecord` and `migrationStateSnapshot`. The snapshot supports
idempotent recovery decisions after an interrupted attempt. The versioned ledger records `started`, `done`,
`notRequired`, `notExecuted`, and `failed` states. Runtime queues and contexts
are isolated per normalized store scope; applications continue to provide only
a `GraphStoreConfiguration`.

`GraphMigrationManager` also supports `record(for:configuration:)` and the
throwing `recordThrowing(for:configuration:)`. Diagnostic clients can read
immutable history and state snapshots through `history(for:configuration:)`
and `stateSnapshot(for:configuration:)`. It also supports
`resetRecord(for:configuration:)`, the additive reset overload accepting
multiple targets, requester and reason, and
`forceMigration(_:configuration:requestedBy:reason:)` for a one-shot local
force request. `GraphMigrationRequestedBy` includes `.system`,
`.migrationManager`, `.supportCenter`, `.user`, and `.recovery`.
Reset and force requests preserve ledger history. Application migration errors
are delivered as `GraphFailure.migration`; environment routing, scope keys, and
KVS projection details remain internal to GraphEvo.

`GraphMigrationLedgerEntry` is a public, immutable, `Codable` diagnostic value.
It includes the migration state, phase, operation and generation identifiers,
request origin, pseudonymous device identifier, application and model versions,
backup reference, decision metadata, source, timestamps, store scope, and any
error or reset reason. `GraphMigrationDecisionReason` and
`GraphMigrationDecisionSource` are public supporting enums.

The internal schema-1 ledger keeps its current projection separate from its
append-only history and transaction journal. Recovery is driven by the
`migrationStateSnapshot` passed to `needsRun`; an interrupted attempt is
evaluated in its originally recorded lifecycle phase.

`MigrationBackupManager` backs up SQLite files and their optional WAL/SHM
sidecars. `ConflictPolicy` supports `.duplicate`, `.skip`, and `.overwrite`.
File logging is disabled by default and can be enabled with
`GraphMigrationLogger.fileLoggingEnabled = true`.

## 10. Utilities

### Migration recovery summaries

`GraphMigrationManager.recoverySummary(for:configuration:) throws -> GraphMigrationRecoverySummary?`
reads the latest local historical recovery publication. Nil means unavailable.
`recordRecoverySummary(for:configuration:recoveryID:recordsRequiringManualReview:) throws`
persists an application-confirmed completed publication without changing migration
state. A repeated latest recoveryID does not replace the snapshot. Counts must
be nonnegative and identities nonempty.

`GraphMigrationRecoverySummary` is Codable, Equatable and Sendable and exposes
`recoveryID: String`, `completedAt: Date`, `recordsRequiringManualReview: Int`,
and `requiresManualReview: Bool`. It survives evaluation resets and failed retries;
it is not a live count or synchronized through KVS.
`Notification.Name.graphMigrationRecoverySummaryDidChange` is delivered on the
main queue after a changed save. Its object is the Sendable value
`GraphMigrationRecoverySummaryChange` exposing `storeScope: String`,
`migrationID: String`, `version: Int`, and `summary: GraphMigrationRecoverySummary`.
Read on launch as well as observing notifications; journal replay does not emit
a new notification. No domain data is read by either API.

Public utility types include `Model`, `GraphJSON`, `AnyCodable`,
`AnyCodableObject`, `NSArrayOfAnyCodableObject`,
`DictionaryOfAnyCodableObject`, `GraphArchiver`, `GraphValueTransformer`,
`File`, and `GraphStoreMetadata`.

Use `GraphValueTransformer.register()` when configuring a model manually.
`GraphStoreMetadata` handles compatibility/version metadata but does not
replace semantic data migrations.

## 11. Merge and deduplication

`GraphMergeEngine` imports entities from a secondary graph, recreates
relationships and actions, and returns `GraphMergeReport`. Imported entities
receive a `source` property.

`GraphDedupEngine.deduplicate(in:configuration:)` is the general-purpose
deduplication entry point. Configure a `DedupKeyProvider`, a
`DedupSurvivorSelector`, and, when needed, a custom `DedupMetadataMerger`.
`UUIDFieldKeyProvider` supplies the standard UUID-field strategy.

The default link policy rewires and deduplicates both relationships and
actions. Metadata copies only missing properties and merges tags and groups
without duplicates. The engine may delete objects and rewrite links; create a
backup before running it on production data.

## 12. Unsupported implementation details

Core Data `Managed*` classes, `Container`, `Context`, registries, coordinators,
and `internal`/`fileprivate` helpers are not public API contracts. Use the
`Entity`, `Relationship`, and `Action` facades.

## 13. Integration checklist

1. Configure `GraphStoreConfiguration` and, when needed, CloudKit.
2. Create `Graph` and handle `whenReady` or `eventDelegate`.
3. Create nodes through `Entity(type, graph:)`, mutate properties, and call
   `sync`.
4. Use `Search` for queries and `Watch` for local/CloudKit callbacks.
5. Prepare Persistent History after the container opens.
6. Register migrations before creating the graph and back up before modifying a
   SQLite store.
7. Handle `GraphStoreOpeningError.incompatibleStore` explicitly; GraphEvo
   leaves incompatible stores unchanged.
